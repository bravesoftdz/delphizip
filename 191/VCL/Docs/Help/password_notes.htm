            <p>The &quot;<a href="getaddpassword.htm">GetAddPassword</a> &quot; and &quot; <a href="getextrpassword.htm">GetExtrPassword</a> &quot; methods are optional. You have 4 different ways of getting a user&#39;s password:</p>
            <p><b>1.</b> Call the &quot;GetAddPassword&quot; and/or the &quot;GetExtrPassword&quot; methods, just before add or extract.</p>
            <p><b>2.</b> Use your own code to set the &quot;Password&quot; property.&nbsp; It&#39;s your choice how you obtain the password.</p>
            <p>- This is useful if the password comes from a file or table.</p>
            <p>- It&#39;s also good for letting you enforce constrains on the password - you can require it to be over 6 chars, require it to have at least one special char, etc.&nbsp; Of course, you&#39;d only want to enforce constraints on &quot;Add&quot; operations.&nbsp; A word of caution: many users don&#39;t like password constraints, so give them the option to turn them off.</p>
            <p><b>3.</b> Don&#39;t set one at all, and let the component prompt the user. It&#39;s easy, and it works.</p>
            <p><b>4.</b> Set the password in the <a href="onpassworderror_event.htm">OnPasswordError</a> event. This is also the most flexible way of doing it.</p>
            <p>Passwords can not be longer than 80 characters. A zero-length password is the same as no password at all.</p>
            <p>To &quot;zero out&quot; the password, set it&#39;s property to an empty string. If it is zeroed out, but the <a href="addoptions_property.htm#addencrypt">AddEncrypt</a> option is set, then the user will be prompted for a new password by the component. So, if you don&#39;t want a password used, make sure you turn off &quot;AddEncrypt&quot;, and you zero-out the password.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>If you set a password for an Extract, but it is incorrect, then the <a href="onpassworderror_event.htm">OnPasswordError</a> event will be triggered <a href="passwordreqcount_property.htm">PasswordReqCount</a> times if you still do not supply a correct password Extraction will not take place.</p>
            <p>To Force the DLL to AVOID decrypting an encrypted file, you must set the password property to an empty string and set to <a href="passwordreqcount_property.htm">PasswordReqCount</a> to zero.&nbsp; If Adding, make sure AddEncrypt is NOT set.</p>
